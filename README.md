Rock Paper Scissors Game

I created this website with a very simple idea, to pass time and have fun!
Since the Pandemic began, socially interacting with people has been a struggle.
Being indoors for most of the day, taking online classes and conversing over zoom is the new day-to-day.
During this time of staring on my screen I thought to myself "i need a break. I'd love to play a quick game", but not with 
the stress the accompanies firing up a playstation and loading a highly competitive game. Just looking for something easy, quick and fun.

I challenged myself to code an interactive online game. Not against other players, but against the greatest competitor the human race has ever had, The computer. I got to work and ended up with a neat little website that allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Simple but very thrilling. 


Features

Upon entering the website you're greeted with a scoreboard "User vs Computer" and three choices of attack, Rock, Paper or Scissors. 
After picking your poisonpoint of attack the scoreboard should update a score and return a sentence like "Paper covers Rock" or "Rock beats Scissors".


Existing Features

At the top of the page is Title of the game "Rock Paper Scissors".
The User vs Computer scoreboard sits below the title and has a functioning scoreboard.
Below the scoreboard is the text returning after each go. This text describes the result of the game after each turn.


Testing


After getting my HTML, CSS and Javascript in order I made sure the website was functioning well. Some things I had to look out for is the functioning of the scoreboard. Originally it reset after each turn or once it reached a point. After fixing that, the text was off so some styling in CSS took care of that.

 I ran my HTML code through the official W3C validator and corrected my errors until it came back perfect.

 I took the same approach with my CSS code, except I ran that through the jigsaw w3 CSS validator.

  I made sure the project works on different screen sizes and browsers.
